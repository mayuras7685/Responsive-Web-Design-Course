        <h3 id="headline">Here's a Journey of Ms Dhoni:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1981</strong> - Born in Ranchi</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2003</strong> - He was recognised for his efforts in the
            2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for
            the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[49] Against the
            Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> - he was picked in the ODI squad for the
            Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[55] Dhoni did not have a great start to
            his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[56] In spite of
            an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the
            Pakistan ODI series.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - MS Dhoni was chosen to lead India in
            first-ever World T20 in 2007. He made his captaincy debut against
            Scotland but the match was washed off. Thereon, he led India to the
            ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa, with a victory over
            arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September
            2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - “Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent
            strike into the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - Won Champions trophy "Don't look up, God is
            not coming to save you:" MS Dhoni
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2019</strong> - MS Dhoni played his final international
            match and millions of hearts were broken
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - MS Dhoni announced his retirement from all
            forms of international cricket "Thanks a lot for ur love and support
            throughout. from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired."
